## The Joy of Python for Testers - Workbook for 2-day version

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this document and related code examples is to act as accompanying material to the workshop by Rahul Verma. 

It contains the primary pieces of building blocks as per the flow of the workshop. So, it provides supporting pieces for the workshop.

The workshop encourages the participants to continue practising Python after the workshop. So, a secondary and yet very important purpose of this content is to enable the participants to go through the learning on their own by coding the exercises without interruption.
